Backstroke lover always hidin' 'neath the cover
'Till I talked to my daddy he say
He said, you ain't seen noting
'Till you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways

I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I can reminisce
Ah the best thing lovin' with her sister and her cousin
Started with a little kiss, like this

See-saw swingin' with the boys in the school
With your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle
You be swingin' like you just didn't care
